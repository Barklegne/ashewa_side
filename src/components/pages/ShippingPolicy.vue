        <p>
          You can choose not to accept an item on the spot (for example in the
          unlikely case that it was the wrong item). It is not possible to open
          products bearing a manufacturerâ€™s seal and to return them on the spot.
          For multiple items in an order, your items will be consolidated into
          the fewest number of shipments possible but there will only be one
          shipping charge for the entire order. However, please note that you
          may receive separate shipments if items ordered are of different
          fulfilment methods. Business days are from Monday to Friday, they do
          NOT include weekends or public holidays. Nevertheless, we do attempt
          delivery on Saturdays.
