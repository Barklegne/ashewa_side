          Central What is Seller Central?Once you register as an Ashewa seller,
          you’ll have access to your Seller Central account. Think of Seller
          Central as your go-to resource for selling on Ashewa. It’s a portal to
          your ashewa business and a one-stop shop for managing your selling
          account, adding product information, making inventory updates,
          managing payments, and finding helpful content to help you navigate
          your ashewa business. It’s also where you list all your products.
          Below are a just few of the things you can do from Seller Central.

          Inventory tab Download custom business reports and bookmark templates

          you sell on Ashewa Listing your first product To sell a product on
          ashewa, you must first create a product listing. Either match an
          existing listing (if somebody else is already selling the same product
          on ashewa), or create a new listing (if you are the first or only
          seller). The specific way sellers upload and list their products
          varies depending on their selling plan. To put it simply: Sellers
          using a Professional seller account have the option of listing their
          products in large batches using bulk uploading or inventory management
          with third-party systems, while Individual sellers list products one
          at a time. Once you successfully list your product, it will become
          available to both B2C and B2B customers. This enables you to extend
          the reach of your offers from a single account and without any
          additional fees.
