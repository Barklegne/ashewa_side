        <h2 class="ml-1 mb-2">Listing your first product</h2>
        <p>
          To sell a product on Ashewa, you must first create a product listing.
          Either match an existing listing (if somebody else is already selling
          the same product on Ashewa), or create a new listing (if you are the
          first or only seller).
        </p>
        <p>
          The specific way sellers upload and list their products varies
          depending on their selling plan. To put it simply: Sellers using a
          Professional seller account have the option of listing their products
          in large batches using bulk uploading or inventory management with
          third-party systems, while Individual sellers list products one at a
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you successfully list your product, it will become available to
          both B2C and B2B customers. This enables you to extend the reach of
          your offers from a single account and without any additional fees.
