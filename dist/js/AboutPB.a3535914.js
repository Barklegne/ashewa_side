Think of Seller Central as your go-to resource for selling on Ashewa. It’s a portal to your ashewa business and a one-stop shop for managing your selling account, adding product information, making inventory updates, managing payments, and finding helpful content to help you navigate your ashewa business. It’s also where you list all your products. Below are a just few of the things you can do from Seller Central. Keep track of your inventory and update your listings from the Inventory tab Download custom business reports and bookmark templates you use often Use customer metrics tools to monitor your seller performance Contact Selling Partner Support and open help tickets using the Case Log Keep track of your daily sales for all the products you sell on Ashewa Listing your first product To sell a product on ashewa, you must first create a product listing. Either match an existing listing (if somebody else is already selling the same product on ashewa), or create a new listing (if you are the first or only seller). The specific way sellers upload and list their products varies depending on their selling plan. To put it simply: Sellers using a Professional seller account have the option of listing their products in large batches using bulk uploading or inventory management with third-party systems, while Individual sellers list products one at a time. Once you successfully list your product, it will become available to both B2C and B2B customers. This enables you to extend the reach of your offers from a single account and without any additional fees.
